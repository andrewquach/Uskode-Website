  <br />
  Massage induces an important relaxation, emotional as well as physical. But the effects of massage are much larger. It stimulates the circulation blood and lymph, reduces discomfort caused by stress and overwork (back pain, lack of energy, insomnia...) or by functional problems (bad digestion, constipation, migraine...) Moreover, it helps to get the body back into harmony and balance.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Foot reflexology</strong> is a &quot;pressure therapy&quot; and involves applying focused pressure to certain known reflex points located in the foot to cure or prevent disease. Foot reflexology is based on the premise that our nerve zones or reflex points go from th<img src="images/foot_2.jpg" width="222" height="149" class="foot" />e bottom of our feet to the top of our head, encompassing all vital organs on the way. <br />
  <br />
  Benefits of a foot reflexology session are manifold - calmness and serenity, improved circulation, increased energy, and balanced emotions among many others. Foot reflexology invigorates tired, aching, and sore feet - leaving your feet fresh, attractive and tingling and you feeling better all over.<br />
    <br />
    Besides massage therapy, Kohong also carries various<strong> natural health food</strong>. Take ‘3-IN-1 POLLERN-R’ as example, it is a combination of honey, pollen and jelly, the three important products of the bee hive, in ideal proportion to give you the best nutritional value.<br />
  <br />
  Honey gives you instant energy and improves the absorption of nutrition, and Bee Pollen provides nutritions to body issue. Royal Jelly, as compared to honey and bee pollen as well as other health food, is even more miraculous. It is a complex mixture of proteins, amino acids lipids, carbohydrates and vitamins particularly panthothenic acid. Fresh royal jelly is secreted by the hypopharyngeal glands of the worker bees during the digestion of pollens and honey. It is fed to the queen bees throughout their larval and adult lives, and also to the young worker and drone larvae.<br />
  <br />
  Infrared Rays can accomplish warming effect, improving metabolism, blood circulation or maintaining the freshness of food, promoting yeast and mature. Kohong therefore has introduced a set of Magnets Equipments including Magnetic bed, Magnetic pillow, and Magnetic belt etc. Magnets exert a powerful attraction on the iron content in the blood, penetrating the outer layers of skin, muscle and fatty tissue to the capillaries that feed directly into the bloodstream. <br />
  <br />
  According to many doctors’ research, they discovered that if human body can absorb certain level of magnetic rays, it will help to remove the stiffness of shoulder or neck, and the pain of waist and joins, also help to improve the physical strength, appetite, spirited and be able in east of sleep, all these are having great and obvious astonishing effect.
